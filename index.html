    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Radhika Sharma, and I am a professional sales executive. It has been a decade that I have been working in the textile world. Currently, I have been working with Dmaasa for 1 year.

      During my tenure in the textile industry, I have come across various kinds of textile and home & living products such as canvas fabric, indigo fabric, tie and dye shibori fabric, hand block print fabric, <a href="https://dmaasa.in/collections/duvet-covers-and-duvet-blanket-online">duvet covers</a>, midi dresses, sarees, cotton fabric, Jaipuri razai, dining table covers, comforters, printed cotton fabric for kurtis, curtains, cushions, pillowcases, and many more. Besides sales, I love decorating my room with handmade products and experimenting with various outfits using fabrics.
